Known Issue:
autoGather intervals causing issues when multiple instances have been activated.
Verify that multiple autoGather upgrades can be started at different times.
Seems as though only one plays animation when two have been unlocked, but both gain value. They also gain value at incorrect timings - almost as if doubled when two have been activated which are 0.5 (Coal, Water).

Known Issue:
Every once in a while, either due to currency increasing animation or resource light up animation, I can see a small chunk of text near the currency value. This seems almost as if it's leftover from the currency animation but I will need to do some testing to see what this might actually be.
