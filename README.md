## Gameplay

### Resource Gathering
Click on resources in the **Gather Panel** to spend energy and gather items. Each resource has a unique energy cost and provides experience points to help you level up. Resources become available based on your level.

### Crafting Potions
Use the **Crafting Panel** to combine resources and create potions. Each crafted item has its own requirements and provides buffs or boosts when created. Higher-level items require more resources and energy but yield more rewards.

### Leveling and Upgrades
Gaining experience through gathering and crafting will help you level up. Each level unlocks new resources and crafting recipes. Additionally, upgrade options appear as you level up, allowing you to increase your currency gain rate, reduce energy costs, and more.

### Energy Management
Energy is required for gathering resources. It passively regenerates over time, and upgrades can boost the rate of energy regeneration.

### Currency and Income Rate
Currency represents the funds collected in-game. The **income rate** determines how much currency is earned per second, automatically increasing based on upgrades. Currency can be used to purchase upgrades that further boost your gathering efficiency and income.
